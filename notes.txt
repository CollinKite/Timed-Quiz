Program will read in quiz provided via a CSV file in same directory. (Should default to "problems.csv" but user should be able to choose filename via a flag.

CSV:
question,answer

At the end of the quiz the program should output the total number of questions correct and how many questions there were in total. Questions given invalid answers are considered incorrect.

CSV files may have questions with commas in them. Eg: "what 2+2, sir?",4 is a valid row in a CSV. I suggest you look into the CSV package in Go and don't try to write your own CSV parser.

After above is created add a quiz timer with a set time that can be updated via a flag. Timer should end quiz immediatly not after user finishes question.
